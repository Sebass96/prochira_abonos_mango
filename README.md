# Impact of organic fertilizers on the quality and postharvest
management of mango ‘Kent’ (*Mangifera indica* L.)


## ABSTRACT

Mango (*Mangifera indica* L.) is a fruit tree with high global demand.
Its fruit presents morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes
during maturation. An adequate nutrient supply during different
physiological stages is key to increasing fruit yield and quality. This
research was conducted in the Piura region of Peru; eight-year-old mango
trees of the ‘Kent’ variety, were planted at a distance of 7 × 7 m
during the 2022–2023 season. A 3 × 3 factorial design with three
replications was employed, where the first factor was the application of
compost at 0, 5, and 15 t/ha, and the second factor was the application
of biol at concentrations of 0%, 5%, and 10%. The results revealed that
combined organic fertilization with compost and biol positively affected
fruit yield and quality, as it improved fruit firmness, increased
soluble solids and dry matter content, and decreased titratable acidity
and fruit dehydration during the physiological and commercial maturity
stages. These results demonstrate that applying organic fertilizers
significantly enhances the quality of mango fruits.
